# General instructions

This application is designed and will run better on a Java 17 runtime environment and its purpose is to test your programming skills, some algorithm skills and your refactoring skills, for that we ask you to resolve the following challenges:

+ Instantiate the application and test the currently existing endpoint
+ Resolve any existing issues
+ Add the logic for the remaining endpoints according to the description provided on the method signature
+ Write unit tests for the code you added

These are the basic exercises, if you have additional time please:

+ Refactor the existing code so it follows best practices
+ Make the code work in a way that the changes made in the csv file reflects without the need for a restart of the application
+ Add code that allows you to add the property Zip Code for the capitol city of the entries, this information can be retrieved using Zippopotamus API, for example this is the call for Mexico City zip codes
  https://api.zippopotam.us/mx/dif/mex in case multiple zip codes are returned from the api select the first one on the list.
